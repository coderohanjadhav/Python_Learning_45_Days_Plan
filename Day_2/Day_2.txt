List :

Python lists are one of the most powerful and widely used data structures.
They allow you to store multiple items in a single variable.

✔ Lists preserve order (ordered).
✔ Lists allow duplicates.
✔ Lists are mutable (can be changed).

How Indexing works it works like it start with index which is mentioned and end befor the last index is mentioned.
list[start:end:step]
step is nothing but that every step will be gather for output.
if mentioned 2 so every second step of list will include as per the conditon.
#Example: L2 = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
print(L2[2:6])
#output:
[3, 4, 5, 6]
